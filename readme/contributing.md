The test suite is implemented with
[nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit) and
[nixt](https://github.com/vesln/nixt).

To rebuild & run the tests

    $ git clone https://github.com/tanglejs/tangle.git
    $ cd tangle
    $ npm install
    $ grunt test

You can use `grunt watch` to automatically rebuild and run the test suite when
files are changed.
